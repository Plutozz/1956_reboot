 dnmflava.1.d:0 "On 20th May at Spithead, the Royal Navy gathered to celebrate the coronation of King George VI. It was the largest collection of warships since 1911, including five aircraft carriers, 10 capital ships, and foreign visitors included the KMS Admiral Graf Spee, the USS New York, the brand new Dunkerque from France, the elderly Soviet battleship Marat and the heavy cruiser Ashigara from Japan. The Dominions were represented by two warships from Canada, one from New Zealand and there was also a ship from the British Raj. All in all some 101 surface warships were present along with 22 submarines and 11 auxiliary vessels.\n\nReviewing the fleet from the Royal Yacht Victoria and Albert, the event was popularised in cinema newsreels in Britain and around the world, emphasising that the first line of defence of Britain and her Empire was The Royal Navy. At night the entire fleet was lit up by their own searchlights, prompting a drunk and excitable BBC reporter, Thomas Woodrooffe, to keep repeating 'The Fleet's lit up' before eventually collapsing into incoherence."

 dnmflava.3.d:0 "In May 1937, the ship was docked in the port of Palma on the island of Majorca, along with several other neutral warships, including vessels from the British and Italian navies. The port was attacked by Republican aircraft, though anti-aircraft fire from the warships drove them off. While moored in port there, she was again attacked by a pair of Soviet-built BB-2 bombers, secretly flown by Soviet Air Force pilots.Two bombs struck the ship. The attack killed 31 German sailors and wounded 74.\n\n[GER.GetLeader], furious over the attack, ordered Admiral Scheer to bombard the port of Almeira in retaliation for the so-called 'Deutschland Incident'. This occurred on the 31st of May as Scheer and four destroyers bombarded the town. The German ships fired 200 shells at the town, killing 19-20 civilians, wounding 50 and destroying 35 buildings. Indalecio Prieto, the Republican minister of Defence wanted to attack the German fleet, but the president [SPR.GetLeader] and the prime minister Juan Negrin opposed to Prieto's plan because an open war against Germany might have brought about the destruction of the Republic. Stalin subsequently issued orders that further attacks on German and Italian warships were strictly prohibited."

Initially intended to serve as Regent, the unwillingness of the former Queen to return to Britain with her two daughters has meant that the new government has prescribed them as 'Abdicated in Absentia'. Consequently, the Duke of Windsor has resumed his role as King Emperor.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC, the new King said that he hoped a lasting period of peace is now on the horizon. He continued to say that 'The guarantees given to us by [GER.GetLeader] will, I am sure, enable Britain to continue in her Imperial role and be a civilising influence upon the World'.\n\nIt is not known if Mrs Simpson will be crowned Queen alongside His Majesty later this year at Westminster."

Present were the Prime Ministers of Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. Also present was the Secretary of State for India and the Chief Minister of Burma. It demonstrated how truly global British interests were. Many sub-committees discussed matters like trade, shipping and so on but one of the main topics was the deteriorating situation in Europe.\n\nAlthough outwardly the conference looked to cement the bonds between the countries, under the surface serious disagreements emerged. On being accused of willing to pay 'any price for peace' by the New Zealand PM [NZL.GetLeader], Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary corrected him by saying: 'Almost any price'. [NZL.GetLeader] retorted that 'You can pay too high a price even for peace', but he was isolated and the conference failed to agree a common foreign policy or a common means for defence.\n\nThe British PM, [ENG.GetLeader], ended the conference saying: 'We are raised from the status of a fourth-rate power to be the heart of an Empire which stands in front of all the Powers of the World'. Privately he was much darker. 'We are a rich and very vulnerable Empire and there are plenty of poor adventurers not very far away who look upon us with hungry eyes'."

 dnmflava.6.d:0 "The visit of the German light cruiser KMS Emden to Montreal in 1936 caused a stir among the local population. Although the nearby German expatriates were cheered by the visit, the ship was met at the quayside by boos and jeers from a crowd of around 200 Canadian citizens demanding the release of political prisoners in Germany. It had been hoped to build on the generally successful visit by KMS Konigsberg to Canada in 1935, but the mixed attitude of the press and the local people meant the visit took on a sour quality.\n\nIn the House of Commons, Samuel Jacobs, Liberal MP for Cartier and also a Jew, asked about the propriety of allowing the Emden to visit. Prime Minister Mackenzie King replied that 'the visit ... has no political significance.'\n\nIt was, though, a goodwill visit, and the goodwill was laid on with a trowel. Local navy reservists joined Emden crew members to heave on the head lines that brought her to her berth. Aircraft dipped their wings overhead. After the lines were secured, the Emden fired an 11-gun salute and her skipper, Captain Johannes Bachmann, went ashore to make an official call on city hall. In one of the more bizarre aspects of the five day visit, local Mohawks were persuaded to initiate Capt Bachmann into their tribe as 'Chief Big River'."

When war broke out again, he was called back to service. Despite his years (he was born in 1878), he remained fit, healthy and energetic, and had the capacity to apply his incisive mind to whatever the Admiralty saw fit to assign him to.\n\nHistorically, his key contribution was running the escort working-up facility at Tobermory (Tobermory Bay is pictured below with Stephenson), where he and his team put 911 ships through 1,132 training courses. He also played a role coordinating the evacuation of Dunkirk in 1940, as well as performed as a Commodore on a number of convoys very early in the war.\n\nTobermory under Stephenson's guidance played an important part in the Battle of the Atlantic, getting escorts out to sea quickly and with effective training. Stephenson's innovative but challenging techniques influenced the Royal Navy's post-war working-up procedures, while also earning him the nickname 'The Terror of Tobermory'."
